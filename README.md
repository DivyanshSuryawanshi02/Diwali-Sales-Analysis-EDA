# Diwali-Sales-Analysis-Using-EDA

## Overview:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is primarily used to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task and provides a better understanding of data set variables and the relationships between them. It can also help determine if the statistical techniques you are considering for data analysis are appropriate. Originally developed by American mathematician John Tukey in the 1970s, EDA techniques continue to be a widely used method in the data discovery process today.<br>
In this project, we'll explore the Diwali Sales dataset. The dataset contains various customers who have purchased different products, their age, gender, marital status, and occupation. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover hidden trends, outliers, correlations, and other important aspects of the data.

The project is structured as follows::<br>
- **Exploratory_Data_Analysis-Diwali_Sales.ipynb** - Here you will find Jupyter notebooks used for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis.
- **Output** - You can place any images generated during your analysis in this folder.
- **Readme.md** - You are reading this file! It provides an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions for running the analysis.
- **Diwali Sales Data.csv** - This directory contains the dataset files.

### Requirements:
To run the notebooks and analysis in this project, you'll need the following:
- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
